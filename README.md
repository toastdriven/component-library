# My Component Library

A collection of my components built for Preact/React.

These make extensive use of [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) & a bit of [Hero Icons](https://heroicons.com/).


## Why?

Because I end up rebuilding these a lot & am tired of rewriting them all the time.

* There's no :rocket: science here.
* Most are pretty simple.
* But huzzah for no longer having to rewrite them!
